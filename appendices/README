This directory should hold the TeX sources for any appendices for the
proposal.  

The most common appendix is for letters of collaboration. The
convention is that collaborations.tex goes here, and includes PDFs of
the letters in ../letters/ (they could be here, but this gets them out
of the way a little more).

As always, other graphics should live in ../graphics/
