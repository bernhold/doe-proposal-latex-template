TeX sources for the technical narrative of the proposal.  

Inclusion of files at the top level is defined in NARRATIVE.tex.
The narrative is a chapter.  Experience suggests that a file per
\subsection is a good granularity to minimize collisions during
editing.  It is simplest to keep this directory flat rather than
hierarchical, and use <section>-<subsection>.tex conventions to name
the files.

Experience also suggests that it is good to avoid explicit sections
deeper than \subsection.  Using \paragraph or just \textbf lead-ins
avoid sections with long strings of numbers identifying them, e.g.,
1.2.3.4.

Graphics included here should be placed in the ../graphics/ directory,
primarily in order to keep directory listings managable.  It is also
useful to place editable sources for graphics in that directory in
case they need to be revised as the proposal evolves.
