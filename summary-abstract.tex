% Project Summary -- ABSTRACT
%
% This is the place for the narrative part of the one-page proposal summary or
% abstract.  The cover page is separate (summary-cover.tex).
%
% If you're desperate for space, you can uncomment the \vspace, which will close
% up the space between the heading and the body of the abstract.
%
% If you're more desperate, you can comment out the heading too.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The rules allow one full page for the abstract, with the cover information
% on a separate page.  So a newpage is allowed here.  Though you might choose
% to comment it out.

\begin{center}
\textbf{ABSTRACT}

% \vspace{-\belowdisplayskip} %% Uncomment to close the space between heading and body

\lipsum %% Obviously you'll want to replace this with your actual abstract
