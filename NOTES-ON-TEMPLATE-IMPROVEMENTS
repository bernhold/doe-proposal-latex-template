Possible improvements to the proposal template system

* Autogenerate files at build?  [how easily is this supported on
  Windows?]  It would prevent people from editing them instead of
  personnel.config.  Add a big warning at the top of the generated
  files not to edit?

* People don't get that bibliographies in bios must have labels
  distinct from those used in other bios or the main bibliography.
  There must be a better way.

* personnel.config should also generate commands to expand each
  participant's name consistently with how it appears in personnel.config.

* A configuration file for institutional participation in portions of
  the project to allow automatic processing to ensure consistency?

* Bring back different content builds (full, technical-only, etc.).
  But make the full build the default.

* Autogeneration for personnel does not handle the case of (last) name
  collisions.

* Autogen for other-support should not include participants at
  unfunded institutions [workaround: can be done manually]

* Need to give labs who haven't submitted FWP, cover, etc. a simple
  path to get the narrative in a form they can assemble
  themselves. Issues include page numbers on front matter that is
  generated, etc. [workaround: generate placeholders with proper
  number of pages]

* Maybe force 'make check' following every build?

* Are Personal bib files the way to go to avoid editing conflicts?
  (But they likely lead to duplicate bibtex entries or if the keys are
  different multiple identical citations)

* Is there a better way to do acronyms? [see glossaries package?]

* hyperlinks to cites? [Conflicts with collapsing ranges]

* hyperlinks to acronyms?

* Ability to slightly scale included PDF pages to allow space for
  headers?  Mainly for budgets.

* More modern bst file to use?

* Figure out how to use latexdiff

* Makefile has a lot of explicit filenames that could be parameterized
  (say you wanted to name your top files something other than
  proposal.*).

* Problems with minitoc contents on lab vs grants build.  Selective
  use of \adjustmtc at table of contents seems to fix, but this is
  probably not the root cause.

* Problems with acronym expansion when generating standalone abstract.
  Seems that adding \typeout statements somehow effect results, but of
  course that shouldn't be.

* Grants.gov lately requires a cover page in front of narrative.
  Creation could be at least partly automated.

* Do a better job with default configuration and/or version control of
  configure.tex

* Acronyms are not a good solution for some institution names (when
  the full name and the short version are too close).

* Why does vertical spacing after the Project Description chapter
  heading change between lab and grants.gov builds?  In one case,
  there is 0.5in of whitespace, while in the other there is none.  Not
  only is it wierd, it can mess up senitive formatting tricks.

* Grants.gov requires separate abstract to be attached.  Suggest using
  separate variant of proposal.tex at top level.  Watch out for name
  conflict with abstract.tex file.

* Switch to using latexmk?

* Maybe institutional cover pages should be generated separately from
  main proposal body and let user combine them with Acrobat or another
  such tool?
