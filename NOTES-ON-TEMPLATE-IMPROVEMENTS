TODO: THIS FILE IS OUT OF DATE AND NEEDS TO BE UPDATED

Possible improvements to the proposal template system

* Bring back different content builds (full, technical-only, etc.).
  But make the full build the default.

* Autogeneration for personnel does not handle the case of (last) name
  collisions.

* More modern bst file to use?

* Figure out how to use latexdiff

* Problems with acronym expansion when generating standalone abstract.
  Seems that adding \typeout statements somehow effect results, but of
  course that shouldn't be.

* Grants.gov lately requires a cover page in front of narrative.
  Creation could be at least partly automated.

* Acronyms are not a good solution for some institution names (when
  the full name and the short version are too close).
