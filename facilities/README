Description of facilities and resources.  One per institution.

Files are included by commands in ../facilities.tex and the
expectation the expectation is that file names will be based on the
institution's name, e.g., ornl.tex or ornl.pdf

The smartinclude command will look for a TeX file, then a PDF file, so
either can be supplied.  TeX following an agreed format will give the
greatest level of consistency and polish to this section, but PDF is
better than nothing.
