\chapter{Facilities and Other Resources}
\label{sec:facilities}

% Four likely scenarios for this appendix:
%
% 1. Everything is covered in the equipment appendix and we just refer there.
% 2. Include per-institution files from this directory based on the CONFIG info
% 3. Just put your content here or \input{} it (esp. single-institution proposals)
%
% Just comment/uncomment the desired choice below

%%%%% 1. Refer to facilities %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Major equipment and facilities available to the project team are described in Appendix~\ref{sec:equipment}.

%%%%% 2. Include file per institution %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The smartinclude command will look for a TeX file, then a PDF file, so either 
% can be supplied.  TeX following an agreed format will give the greatest level
% of consistency and polish to this section, but PDF is better than nothing.

% REQUIREMENT: file names correspond to the institution's shorthand (the 
% instacro field in CONFIG-institutions.csv), e.g., ornl.tex or ornl.pdf.  This 
% is case sensitive on most filesystems.

\noindent Descriptions of facilities available at 
each institution.

% TODO: It would be nice to get rid of the indentation caused by the current
% \etocsettocstyle with empty arguments
\etocsettocstyle{}{}
\etocchecksemptiness
