Current and pending support of investigators, as defined in the FOA.
One per investigator.

Files are included by commands in ../other-support.tex and the
expectation the expectation is that file names will be based on the
individual's last name, e.g., bernholdt.tex or bernholdt.pdf.

The smartinclude command will look for a TeX file, then a PDF file, so
either can be supplied.  TeX following an agreed format will give the
greatest level of consistency and polish to this section, but PDF is
better than nothing.
