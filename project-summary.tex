% Main file for the project summary (cover plus abstract) document
%
% summary-cover.tex displays the title and a table of investigators, based on
% data in CONFIG-proposal.tex and CONFIG-investigators.csv.  If the formatting
% is acceptable and there is sufficient space, you may not need to modify it.
%
% summary-abstract.tex, not surprisingly, displays the abstract.  You'll need 
% to provide the content here.  By default, the abstract starts on a new page.
% This is allowed by DOE's guidelines.  But if you don't like the way it looks
% feel free to comment it out.
