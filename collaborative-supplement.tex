% TODO: This table needs to be modified for the number of years in the
% proposal period of performance.  And, of course, the CONFIG-budget.csv
% file will need to be modified correspondingly.
%
% TODO: Also, it would be nice to have an \hline before the total line.
% Unfortunately, \hline has to immediately follow the (implicit) \\ at the
% row end.  But here we're invoking the \ifthenelse to decide if this is
% the row we want to highlight or not.  So you can't just add \hline at the
% beginning of the true branch.
