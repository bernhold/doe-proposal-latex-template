BibTeX files referenced by the technical narrative of the proposal.

These bib files need to be listed in the \bibliography command in
../proposal.tex.

You are free to organize these files however you like. A single
file. A file per contributor.  A file per section.  Whatever.  They
all have advantages and disadvantages.

But none the approaches protects you from duplicates.  BibTeX will
catch duplicate *keys* (whether they have the same content or not).
But the same bibitem with *different* keys will not be caught.  You
have to check the resulting bibliography carefully for duplicates.
