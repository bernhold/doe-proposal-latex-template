% Cover page for project summary
%
% Based on DOE guidance, the cover includes the title and a table listing all
% investigators.  The abstract is separate.
%
% This implementation uses the csvsimple-l3 package to read 
% CONFIG-investigators.csv and display it as a table.  Plenty of tweaking (or
% even wholesale replacement) opportunities if you want something different.

% Use csvsimple-l3 to create a table from CONFIG-investigators.csv
%
% The default format displays \rolelpi and \rolecpi rows in bold font on a light
% gray background.  \rolesp is not displayed (makes the others stand out
% more).
%
% Given this formatting, the most logical ordering for the input data is:
% 1. Lead institution followed by additional institutions in alphabetical order
%    a. Institutional PI followed by additional investigators in alpha order
%
% An xcolor specification for a very light gray to highlight lead PIs and co-PIs
\definecolor{verylightgray}{rgb}{0.90,0.90,0.90}
%
% Using \rowcolor throws warnings about misplaced \noalign and breaks the build.
% It is not clear why.  Googling has so far been unhelpful.
%
% Thanks to Kemal Benslama of Drew University, we have a workaround, however!
% Using \cellcolor on each field of the row works fine -- there's no visible
% break in the color between columns.
